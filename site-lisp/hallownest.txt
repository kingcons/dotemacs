This is the file HALLOWNEST.TXT, version 1.
Last Edit: 2022-Mar-08

To install on systems using BSD fortune(6), rename this file "hallownest" and
store it in the appropriate fortunes directory, usually /usr/games/fortune
or /usr/share/fortune or something like that. Then in that directory run
strfile(8) on the "hallownest" file which should produce a "hallownest.dat".
To test, go to some other directory with no file called "hallownest" in it, and
say "fortune hallownest". If you get a hollow fortune you win. If not you lose.
To install on other systems simply find a fortune program, install it, and
then install this file. Or write your own fortune program in Lisp.

The newest version of this file can usually be found at
  https://redlinernotes.com/docs/hallownest.txt
If the version at that URL has not changed signifigantly in some time or
if you have contributions you wish to make to this file then please email
the maintainer, Brit Butler at <brit at kingcons dot io>.

If you are using this file in a fortune(6)-like program and you see this
text then your program is borken. It shouldn't display the first fortune in
the file. You lose. Use Lisp instead.

In wilds beyond they speak your name with reverence and regret,
For none could tame our savage souls yet you the challenge met,
Under palest watch, you taught, we changed, base instincts were redeemed,
A world you gave to bug and beast as they had never dreamed.

- From 'Elegy for Hallownest' by Monomon the Teacher
%
Higher beings, these words are for you alone.
These blasted plains stretch never-ending. There is no world beyond.
Those foolish enough to traverse this void must pay the toll and relinquish the precious mind this kingdom grants.
%
Higher beings, these words are for you alone.
Your great strength marks you amongst us. Focus your soul and you shall achieve feats of which others can only dream.
%
Higher beings, these words are for you alone.
Within our lands do not hide your true form. Let all bask in your majesty, for only this kingdom could produce ones such as you.
%
Higher beings, these words are for you alone.
Beyond this point you enter the land of King and Creator.
Step across this threshold and obey our laws.
Bear witness to the last and only civilisation, the eternal Kingdom.
Hallownest
%
Vessel. Though bound, you shall know the state of the world.
Hallownest will be whole again.

The Pilgrim's Way
Travellers of Hallownest, descend through verdant wilds and fungal groves to the city at this kingdom's heart.
There all wishes shall be granted, all truths revealed.
%
From moss and leaf our life is drawn.
While it grows upon the path we shall never wilt.
%
The greater mind once dreamed of leaf and cast these caverns so.
In every bush and every vine the mind of Unn reveals itself to us.
%
The Green Children walked from the dream unto these lands.
Here we now shall wait, patient, for the call to return.
%
Though once our lands, a pale being lays claim to the caverns ahead.
It may appear benevolent but it does not share our dream.
Be wary to wander that place.
%
Those who stray from the White King's roads shall face the law of Unn.
%
Hidden Unn, we need you now.
We grow tired away from you.
Our leaves are falling.
%
Wanderers seeking death, welcome.
May you find swift end upon our claws.
%
The truce remains.
Our vigil holds.
The beasts are kept at bay.
%
This border bounds the twisting, scratching things.
Their dead sire, once of honoured caste.
Their sealed mother, but the common beast.
No peace with them we make.
%
Strength in the shared self.
Strength in the mind united.
In every bug that would pass upon our roads,
only the melancholy of disparity.
%
Warily shall we accept the will of the Wyrm.
Its prescience shields us.
Fate and Future we shall entwine.
%
Here ends the Pilgrim's Way.
Hallownest's Heart lays open before you.
Proceed onward to share in its glory.
%
The great gates have been sealed.
None shall enter.
None shall leave.
%
MEMORIAL TO THE HOLLOW KNIGHT
In the Black Vault far above.
Through its sacrifice Hallownest lasts eternal.
%
The mind still limits us so.
How to break past its constraints?
To attain a pure focus, is it even possible?
%
Spare thought for those consumed.
Through their grace we are evolved.
No plague of mind shall overcome us now.
%
Sleep beckons eternal and these words become my last.
Though my gaze shall no longer fall upon this city, I will act forever in its protection.
For King, for bug, for Hallownest, I head now to my rest.
%
To protect the Vessel, the Dreamers lay sleeping.

Monomon the Teacher
In her Archive, surrounded by fog and mist.

Lurien the Watcher
In his Spire, looking over the city.

Herrah the Beast
In her Den, amidst the deep darkness beyond the kingdom.

Through their devotion, Hallownest lasts eternal.
%
Pity those bugs.
Minds locked. Thoughts trapped in solitude.
Faint shadow of an idea are the words that attempt its utterance.
%
A true servant gives all for the Kingdom.
Let Hallownest's Pale King relieve you of your burden.
%
Higher beings, these words are for you alone.
Our pure Vessel has ascended.
Beyond lies only the refuse and regret of its creation.
We shall enter that place no longer.
%
No blazing kin. Only one light shall shine against the dark.
The Wyrm becomes beacon, minds expanded, to yield, to devote.
Eternity in promise and charge in progeny cursed.
%
We speak the path of the Master Herald, he who would signal an Age's end.
Spawn of self, their minds unite,
Aside the source of acid blight,
Aglow in darkest, winding depths,
Winds all howl above fossilstone steps,
Monarchflys in airs set still,
To Root's domain and snail once shrill,
Path of Wyrm, at new lands entered
There journeys end. The kingdom ventured.
%
I have no offspring, nor subjects, nor worshippers. The sum of my being, my learning, my instincts...
I leave it all to you. Good luck, Hunter.
%
Being back in my old home... I feel the weight of my long life bearing down on me.

I carry it proudly, though. Wherever I travel, the memories of my family and my kind come with me.
